# BinarySearchTree
BST to store "tables" in a tournament. The program then calculates overall excitement of each table based on skill levels of players at that table. The program recursively traverses the tree in order to do this.

Sample Input
5              // number of tables (nodes)            
1 3 4 2        // table activation (traversal)
5 1 4 2 3      // skill levels of each node

Output
8              // overall excitement
